House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.
That is, until he was murdered with an axe.

But then ....
The great doctors of the kingdom saved his life, but he was horribly disfigured forever.
